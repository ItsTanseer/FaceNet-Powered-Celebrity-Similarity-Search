# FaceTwin AI 🎭

**Find the bollywood celebrity you look most like using FaceNet embeddings and deep metric learning.**

##  Overview

FaceTwin AI is a celebrity look-alike detection system that uses **FaceNet**, **MTCNN**, and **cosine similarity** to identify celebrities whose facial features most closely resemble a user's uploaded image.

Instead of treating the task as a traditional classification problem, FaceTwin AI leverages **face embeddings** and **similarity search** to compare facial features in a high-dimensional embedding space.

##  Features

* Upload any image containing a face
* Automatic face detection using MTCNN
* Face embedding generation using FaceNet (InceptionResnetV1)
* Similarity-based celebrity matching
* Returns the Top-3 most similar celebrities
* Streamlit-based interactive web application
* Fast inference using precomputed celebrity embeddings

```

### Step 1: Face Detection

The uploaded image is passed through **MTCNN** to detect and crop the face.

### Step 2: Feature Extraction

The cropped face is passed through a pretrained **FaceNet (InceptionResnetV1)** model trained on the VGGFace2 dataset.

Output:

```

### Step 3: Celebrity Database

For each celebrity:

* Multiple images are collected
* Embeddings are generated for each image
* A representative embedding is obtained by averaging all embeddings

```text

```

### Step 4: Similarity Search

The user's embedding is compared against all celebrity embeddings using cosine similarity.

```text
Higher Similarity
        ↓
More Similar Facial Features
```
